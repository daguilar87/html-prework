                    <p>I have always liked to take things apart to see how things work when something is wrong with my car always get hands on. What I like to do in my spare time is go to the gym helps me clear my mind and makes me feel good pushing a new PR. Another hobby I have is going up to the mountain and ride four wheelers.</p>

                <p>My Goal is to challenge myself more mentality and take more risks. Since a young age I have always worked, once getting out of school I decided to join the workforce and get straight to work learning different trades which have been good to me but I do prefer to use my mind more and problem solve. Another goal that I have that I have put off too the side for to long is learning how to smoke food!</p>

I have a wife named Natalie, my son named Abel, and a german shepherd named Minkah. I currently work at a steel fabrication shop and now looking to make a career change into software enginering. Since middle school I liked the idea of technology and seeing what makes it work that it includes taking it apart and not always able to put it back together slowly learning.I feel outdated when it comes to technology, I am looking to freshen up and acquire new skills it excites me to take this course at Coding Temple and make a life change career and lifestyle!</p>
